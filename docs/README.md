# Project notes

Put design decisions, open questions and anything Claude Code should know
that isn't code here. Keep entries short and dated.

- Started from the airplane-scoring template. macroquad pinned at 0.4.16.

## 2026-11-10
- Mobile-first, **landscape** only (phone held like a steering wheel for tilt).
- Published via GitHub Actions to GitHub Pages; built .wasm is not committed.
- Planned: tilt steering via `deviceorientation` (iOS needs a tap-to-start
  permission prompt; HTTPS required), touch + keyboard fallbacks, all mapped
  to one `steer` value in core.
- Input: every device maps to one `steer` in [-1, 1] (core `input.rs`).
  Touch/mouse = plane flies to the finger's height; keys = Up/W, Down/S.
  Pointer wins over keys. Tilt will be a third source.
- macroquad 0.4.16 quirk: `touches()` is in physical pixels, mouse and
  drawing in logical ones. The game divides touch by `dpi_scale()`.
